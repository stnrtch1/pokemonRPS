To-Dos:
- Add more visuals to the app
- Add customizeable HP, attack power and turn counters

Ideas:
- Add a stat counters for various things, i.e. wins, loses, moves used/selected
- Look into using a JSON file for handling the types
- Make a game mode where there's a 50/50 chance on who goes first
- Look into using VelocityJS or JQuery to make some animations for the app
